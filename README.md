# Text Classification for Covid-19 Scientific Literature


This project works on [Track 5 of BioCreative VII](https://biocreative.bioinformatics.udel.edu/tasks/biocreative-vii/track-5/), the LitCovid track on Multi-label topic classification for COVID-19 literature annotation.

The aim of the LitCovid track is to develop a text classification system that will assign an input scientific article into one or more of the following seven classes: Treatment, Diagnosis, Preven- tion, Mechanism, Transmission, Epidemic Forecasting, and Case Report. A training set of 24,960 articles and a development set of 6,239 articles manually annotated by human experts are [provided](https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/lu/LitCovid/biocreative/).
The training data is included in the BC7-LitCovid-Train.csv file and the development data is included in the BC7-LitCovid-Dev.csv file. 

The training set is used for developing (training and tuning your system) and the development data set is used for evaluation/testing.
the evaluation tool provided at https://github.com/ncbi/biocreative_litcovid is used for evaluating the performance of the system.
